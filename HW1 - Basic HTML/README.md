# Information Systems Design

**Important** This is an individual assignment.

Learn
=====

If you are not already familiar with HTML, spend some time going over
the HTML tutorial at [w3schools](http://www.w3schools.com/html/).

Construct
=========

Start with the `index.html` file that comes with the assignment. Build
an HTML page that contains the following information.

1.  A meaningful title (should appear in the browser window frame)

2.  Several levels of headings, properly nested across the document
    (e.g., an `<h1>` element with nested `<h2>` elements, etc.)

3.  Several paragraphs of ordinary text, including text that is
    highlighted within the paragraph (e.g., strong, etc.)

4.  Two hyperlinks to real locations on the Internet

5.  A table of data containing at least four rows of three columns,
    including a heading row

6.  A simple form that includes:

    -   First name (text box)

    -   Last name (text box)

    -   E-mail address (text box)

    -   Computer preference (dropdown list that allows the user to
        choose one or more of Windows, Linux, or Macintosh)

The content of your page is not particularly important—structure and
format are. You can make up (fun) content, use [lorem
ipsum](http://www.lipsum.com/) text, etc. Don’t worry about a beautiful
design—just get all the aforementioned elements into your page.

Observe
=======

Follow these guidelines:

1.  All HTML elements must be properly nested.

2.  All HTML elements must include both an opening and closing tag.

3.  Any attributes in an opening tag must have values that are quoted.

4.  Select form fields of the appropriate type.

Submit
======

Commit your updated HTML file to Git and push it to Github.
