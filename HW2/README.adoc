Information Systems Design

IMPORTANT: This is an individual assignment.

== Learn

For examples of how to use templates with Flask,
refer to the
https://github.com/tu-isd/talks[sample code covered in class].
The templating language we're using is called Jinja.
Find details on Jinja at
http://jinja.pocoo.org/[its main web page].

== Construct

. Create a base HTML template called `base.html`.
Be sure to store this template in the `templates` directory of your assignment.
. Your base template should have a block
  (i.e., `{% block ... %} ... {% endblock %}`) for
* Page title in the `<head>` element
* Page content in the `<body>` element.
. Create another HTML template called `letters.html`.
This template should
* Inherit from (`extend`) the `base.html` template, and override both `block`s defined there.
* Expect to receive a list of values from its view function
  as a context variable called `letters`.
* Display each element of `letters` as an item (`<li>...</li>`)
  in an ordered list (`<ol>...</ol>`)
* Set the page title to the value `List of Letters`
. Create a new view function called `letters`.
The function should
* Be trigged by a web browser opening the route `/letters`
* Construct a list consisting of the names of the first four letters
  of the Greek alphabet: `alpha`, `beta`, `gamma`, and `delta`.
* Render the `letters.html` template,
  passing it the list of Greek letter names as a context variable.

== Verify

. Run the develoment web server
. Navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/letters`
. Check that the list of letters appears in the browser.
